The first line of output of all the commands should declare whether it was 
successfully executed or it failed.
*If the command was successful, use the following format string:
- ("[%s:SUCCESS]\n", command_str) //where command_str is the command inputted 
without its arguments
*If the command failed with error, use the following format string:
- ("[%s:ERROR]\n", command_str) //where command_str is the command inputted without its arguments

stones, highgate, embankment, underground, and euston

Server/Client shell command:
- AUTHOR: print policy
- IP: print external IP address or ERROR
- PORT: print port number
- LIST: print the logged-in client table
	The output should display the hostname, IP address, 
	and the listening port numbers, 
	sorted by their listening port numbers,
 	in increasing order. E.g.

Server shell command:
- STATISTICS: Display登陆过且没EXIT的client table
	The output should display the hostname, #messages-sent, 
	#messages-received, and the current status: logged-in/logged-out 
	depending on whether the client is currently logged-in or not, 
	sorted by their listening port numbers, in increasing order. E.g.,
- BLOCKED <client-ip>: Display被<client-ip>拉黑的clients table
	The output should display the hostname, IP address, 
	and the listening port numbers, sorted by their listening port numbers,
	in increasing order.
	注意：input IP必须vaild且是存在的

信息传递format：
- ("msg from:%s, to:%s\n[msg]:%s\n", from-client-ip, to-client-ip, msg)
- Broadcast message, <to-client-ip> will be 255.255.255.255
- For the purposes of printing/logging, use command_str: RELAYED

client应该有：
- 自己的IP
- 自己hostname
- port_number
- login状态
- 发了多少消息
- 收到多少消息
- block_list=[hostname, ip, port],[...],[...]
- msg_buffer=[from_ip, rcv_ip, msg],[...],[...]

Client shell command: (./PA1 c <port>并没有connect to the server, 只有Login时候才会链上)
- LOGIN <server-ip> <server-port>:login to the server located at ip address: <server-ip> 
	listening on port: <server-port>
	*On successful registration, the server responds with:
	1. List of all currently logged-in clients. The client should store this list 
	for later display and use.
	2. All the stored/buffered messages for this client in the order they were 
	received at the server.  Each of these messages will trigger an 
	*[EVENT]: Message Received
	- ("msg from:%s\n[msg]:%s\n", client-ip, msg)
	- Note that <client-ip> here is the IP address of the original sender, 
		not of the relaying server. For the purposes of printing/logging, 
		use command_str: RECEIVED
	*client未登录的情况下只能用以下几个command: 
	- LOGIN, EXIT, IP, PORT, and AUTHOR, or receive packets
- REFRESH: get updated list of current logged-in client from the server
- SEND <client-ip> <msg>: msg length < 256bytes & valid ASCII characters
	- send to logged-in user only, 这会用到login时候server反馈给你的client_list 
- BROADCAST <msg>: Send <msg> to all logged-in clients.
	This should be a server-assisted broadcast. The sending client should 
	send only one message to the server, indicating it is a broadcast. 
	The server then forwards/relays this message to all the currently 
	logged-in clients and stores/buffers the message for the others.
	注:发广播的client不会收到这个<msg> back。
- BLOCK <client-ip>: 屏蔽<client-ip>发的所有消息，server应该知道这个屏蔽，
	server不会储存被屏蔽的client的消息。被屏蔽的client不会意识到被对方
	屏蔽了，所以ta发消息还是可以照常发。
	注意：IP必须vaild且存在，若是已经被屏蔽的client-ip该如何处理(?)
- UNBLOCK <client-ip>: 解除屏蔽，server得知道
	注意：IP必须vaild且存在，若是没被屏蔽又如何解除屏蔽呢？
- LOGOUT: 退出登录但您的application不应该退出，而应该继续接受登录、退出、
	IP、端口和作者命令。
	注意(最好问问TA):
	- LOGOUT does NOT reset the statistic counters (see STATISTICS command 
		in section 5.5).
	- LOGOUT does NOT unblock any clients blocked by this client.
	- LOGOUT does NOT change the blocked/unblocked status of this 
		client on the server.
- EXIT: Logout from the server (if logged-in) and terminate the application with
	exit code 0. This should delete all the state for this client on the server. 
	You can assume that an EXITed client will never start again.
	这是否存在statistics里？还是除去？若存在status是否改成logged-out?
